## Safety Skills Program (Example Code)

I developed this program as part of a research project which is now published in
the [Journal of Applied Behavior Analysis](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jaba.105/abstract).

The program was built using Adobe Flash and actionscript. At the time, I chose this option
because it would allow me to create a fun game-like experience for the children participating
in the study. Unfortunately, all the resources were not backed up, so this repository serves only
as an example of the project.

However, you can find more information in the [article](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jaba.105/abstract) or view a [video demo](https://vimeo.com/140873916) of the computer program.
